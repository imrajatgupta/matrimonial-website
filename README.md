# matrimonial-website

A Matrimonial website created in year 2015 to showcase at the University as a 3rd year Minor Project to the Professors.
Me and my friend Pranshur Dubey edited and customized a template from the web to suit our needs.

***I don't own the Rights for the template I used to create this website and I don't have the information about the person who created this template.***

This is the very first website that we created while learning ASP.NET, C#, HTML and CSS. The project is not documented because we didn't knew how to document our projects back then. The project was build in `Microsoft Visual Studio 2010`.

In the repository you'll find `Documentation.pdf` which is the professional documentation for the project which includes:

1) The members
2) Responsibilites
3) Mentor
4) University
5) Project
6) Technologies
7) Screenshots
8) Diagrams
